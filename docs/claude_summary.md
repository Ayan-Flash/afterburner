# Claude Handoff Summary

This document is a compact handoff for the current state of the GPUControl Pro workspace.

## Current Project State

- The repo is a Windows-focused Tauri monorepo with a Rust backend in [apps/backend](../apps/backend) and a React + TypeScript frontend in [apps/frontend](../apps/frontend).
- Shared packages live under [packages](../packages), currently split into common, monitoring, and plugins.
- The documentation set already includes [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md), [docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md](PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md), [docs/ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md), and [docs/CODING_GUIDELINES.md](CODING_GUIDELINES.md).
- The backend codebase is already organized into feature areas such as ai, alerts, automation, backup, commands, database, enterprise, hardware, integrations, marketplace, monitoring, overlay, plugins, remote, reporting, stores, sync, and utils.

## Active Technical Themes

- Hardware monitoring remains the core product area, with backend modules expected to own GPU, system, and monitoring data collection.
- Overlay support is a visible product goal and should be treated as a real windowing feature, not just a state flag.
- The project structure suggests future expansion into enterprise, remote, marketplace, and automation capabilities.

## Handoff Notes

- No code changes are recorded in this summary.
- Use this file as a quick context reset before continuing implementation work.
- If the repo has moved since this was last updated, prefer the architecture and project structure docs as the source of truth.
